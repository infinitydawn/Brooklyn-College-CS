THE SUN DID NOT SHINE.
IT WAS TOO WET TO PLAY.
SO WE SAT IN THE HOUSE
ALL THAT COLD, COLD, WET DAY.
I SAT THERE WITH SALLY.
WE SAT THERE, WE TWO.
AND I SAID, "HOW I WISH
WE HAD SOMETHING TO DO."
TOO WET TO GO OUT
AND TOO COLD TO PLAY BALL.
SO WE SAT IN THE HOUSE.
WE DID NOTHING AT ALL.
SO ALL WE COULD DO WAS TO
SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT.
AND WE DID NOT LIKE IT.
NOT ONE LITTLE BIT.
AND THEN
SOMETHING WENT BUMP.
HOW THAT BUMP MADE US JUMP.
WE LOOKED.
THEN WE SAW HIM STEP IN ON THE MAT.
WE LOOKED.
AND WE SAW HIM.
THE CAT IN THE HAT.
AND HE SAID TO US,
"WHY DO YOU SIT THERE LIKE THAT?"
"I KNOW IT IS WET
AND THE SUN IS NOT SUNNY.
BUT WE CAN HAVE
LOTS OF GOOD FUN THAT IS FUNNY."
"I KNOW SOME GOOD GAMES WE COULD PLAY,"
SAID THE CAT.
"I KNOW SOME NEW TRICKS,"
SAID THE CAT IN THE HAT.
"A LOT OF GOOD TRICKS.
I WILL SHOW THEM TO YOU.
YOUR MOTHER
WILL NOT MIND AT ALL IF I DO."
THEN SALLY AND I
DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
OUR MOTHER WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE
FOR THE DAY.
BUT OUR FISH SAID, "NO, NO,
MAKE THAT CAT GO AWAY.
TELL THAT CAT IN THE HAT
YOU DO NOT WANT TO PLAY.
HE SHOULD NOT BE HERE.
HE SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT.
HE SHOULD NOT BE HERE
WHEN YOUR MOTHER IS OUT."
"NOW, NOW, HAVE NO FEAR.
HAVE NO FEAR," SAID THE CAT.
"MY TRICKS ARE NOT BAD,"
SAID THE CAT IN THE HAT.
"WHY, WE CAN HAVE
LOTS OF FUN, IF YOU WISH,
WITH A GAME THAT I CALL
UP UP UP WITH A FISH."
"PUT ME DOWN," SAID THE FISH.
"THIS IS NO FUN AT ALL."
"PUT ME DOWN," SAID THE FISH.
"I DO NOT WISH TO FALL."
"HAVE NO FEAR," SAID THE CAT.
"I WILL NOT LET YOU FALL.
I WILL HOLD YOU UP HIGH
AS I STAND ON A BALL.
WITH A BOOK ON ONE HAND.
AND A CUP ON MY HAT.
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL I CAN DO,"
SAID THE CAT.
"LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME NOW," SAID THE CAT.
"WITH A CUP AND A CAKE
ON THE TOP OF MY HAT,
I CAN HOLD UP TWO BOOKS,
I CAN HOLD UP THE FISH,
AND A LITTLE TOY SHIP,
AND SOME MILK ON A DISH.
AND LOOK,
I CAN HOP UP AND DOWN ON THE BALL,
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL.
OH NO.
THAT IS NOT ALL.
LOOK AT ME,
LOOK AT ME,
LOOK AT ME NOW.
IT IS FUN TO HAVE FUN
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW.
