 * description: this program is used to read data set of temperatures from a
 * file to calculate the wind chill index per each data set, and then calculate
 * the averages of temperature, wind speed, and wind chill index. If temperature
 * is presented in celcius it is converted to fahrenheight. Data sets with 
 * airspeed over 120mph and/or temperature higher than 50F will be rejected. 
 * Each data set is printed out to a file along with it's number and wind chill
 * index. Once there are no more data sets in the file, the program calculates 
 * and displays the average values of all data sets.
 *
 * Steps taken: Firstly, I wrote the Pseudo code in main function. Then I 
 * wrote my import statements and setup the while loop to read from file. 
 * The next step was writing the functions and testing them one by one to ensure
 * smooth operation. Finally, I updated my code to save results to a text file.
 *
 * Opinion: I believe it's an interesting approach to calculate what the 
 * temperature feels like. I wonder how accurate is it in the real world. 
 * For the most part, this assignment was completed without any problems except
 * I made some minor adjustments to the variable types as calculations were off
 * when I calculated the averages.
