Description: this program is used to read data set of temperatures from a file to calculate the wind chill index per each data set, 
and then calculate the averages of temperature, wind speed, and wind chill index.
If temperature is presented in celcius it is converted to fahrenheight. 
Data sets with airspeed over 120mph and/or temperature higher than 50F will be rejected. 
Each data set is printed out to a file along with it's number and wind chill index. 
Once there are no more data sets in the file, the program calculates and displays the average values of all data sets.

Wind Chill Index: It is the temperature it “feels like” outside and is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by the effects of wind and cold
