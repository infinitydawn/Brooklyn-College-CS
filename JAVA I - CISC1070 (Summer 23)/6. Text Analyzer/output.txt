 THE SUN DID NOT SHINE. IT WAS TOO WET TO
 PLAY. SO WE SAT IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT COLD,
 COLD, WET DAY. I SAT THERE WITH SALLY. WE SAT
 THERE, WE TWO. AND I SAID, "HOW I WISH WE
 HAD SOMETHING TO DO." TOO WET TO GO OUT AND
 TOO COLD TO PLAY BALL. SO WE SAT IN THE
 HOUSE. WE DID NOTHING AT ALL. SO ALL WE COULD
 DO WAS TO SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT. AND WE DID
 NOT LIKE IT. NOT ONE LITTLE BIT. AND THEN SOMETHING
 WENT BUMP. HOW THAT BUMP MADE US JUMP. WE LOOKED.
 THEN WE SAW HIM STEP IN ON THE MAT. WE
 LOOKED. AND WE SAW HIM. THE CAT IN THE HAT.
 AND HE SAID TO US, "WHY DO YOU SIT THERE
 LIKE THAT?" "I KNOW IT IS WET AND THE SUN
 IS NOT SUNNY. BUT WE CAN HAVE LOTS OF GOOD
 FUN THAT IS FUNNY." "I KNOW SOME GOOD GAMES WE
 COULD PLAY," SAID THE CAT. "I KNOW SOME NEW TRICKS,"
 SAID THE CAT IN THE HAT. "A LOT OF GOOD
 TRICKS. I WILL SHOW THEM TO YOU. YOUR MOTHER WILL
 NOT MIND AT ALL IF I DO." THEN SALLY AND
 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY. OUR MOTHER WAS
 OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR THE DAY. BUT OUR FISH
 SAID, "NO, NO, MAKE THAT CAT GO AWAY. TELL THAT
 CAT IN THE HAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO PLAY.
 HE SHOULD NOT BE HERE. HE SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT.
 HE SHOULD NOT BE HERE WHEN YOUR MOTHER IS OUT."
 "NOW, NOW, HAVE NO FEAR. HAVE NO FEAR," SAID THE
 CAT. "MY TRICKS ARE NOT BAD," SAID THE CAT IN
 THE HAT. "WHY, WE CAN HAVE LOTS OF FUN, IF
 YOU WISH, WITH A GAME THAT I CALL UP UP
 UP WITH A FISH." "PUT ME DOWN," SAID THE FISH.
 "THIS IS NO FUN AT ALL." "PUT ME DOWN," SAID
 THE FISH. "I DO NOT WISH TO FALL." "HAVE NO
 FEAR," SAID THE CAT. "I WILL NOT LET YOU FALL.
 I WILL HOLD YOU UP HIGH AS I STAND ON
 A BALL. WITH A BOOK ON ONE HAND. AND A
 CUP ON MY HAT. BUT THAT IS NOT ALL I
 CAN DO," SAID THE CAT. "LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT
 ME NOW," SAID THE CAT. "WITH A CUP AND A
 CAKE ON THE TOP OF MY HAT, I CAN HOLD
 UP TWO BOOKS, I CAN HOLD UP THE FISH, AND
 A LITTLE TOY SHIP, AND SOME MILK ON A DISH.
 AND LOOK, I CAN HOP UP AND DOWN ON THE
 BALL, BUT THAT IS NOT ALL. OH NO. THAT IS
 NOT ALL. LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT
 ME NOW. IT IS FUN TO HAVE FUN BUT YOU
 HAVE TO KNOW HOW. 
